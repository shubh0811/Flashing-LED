# Flashing-LED

Hi, 
Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project that i made. 

Its a easy project to run, in it you will be able to observe the LED flashing, which means 
LED will be glowing than for few seconds it will extinguish and than glow again. 

It is the simple connection made, you can use the schematic if you wish to make 
the project.

If you wish to up-down the timing of the LED glowing and extinguishing , you need 
to change the value of capacitor using. Like, try to increase the value once than decrease
it , you will notice the change glowing and extinguishing in time. 



              # COMPONENTS-USED:

1)LED
2)Transistor- BC547
3)Transistor- BC557
4)Resistor- 22ohm , 1kohm, 1m ohm
(If you dont have 1m ohm resistor, you can also use 2 resistor in series of 500k ohm)
5)Capacitor- 2.2uf
6) Batter-9v or less may also work
7) Few jumper wires 


 Took help from youtube videos!
